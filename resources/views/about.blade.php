					<p>Following a needs assessment, social survey and need expression of the low income women folk  of the Odolewu community,  the Properietor of Christ the King Catholic College Odolewu, Most Rev Bishop Fasina, Bishop of Ijebu-Ode Diocese,  through the effort of Rev. Fr. Patrick Balogun (Director of Education) at the time, Rev. Fr. Emmmanuel Matuluko (Principal at the time) and Mr Augustine Odukoya (Finance Director) established, what was then <strong>Christ the King Savings and Credit Scheme.</strong> This was to be a visible expression of the social responsibility of the College to the immediate community. The Scheme kicked-off on October 2, 2009 at the Odolewu office (oposite Chief Adefuye's residence) with some women traders from Odolewu, Igbaga, Odonoko, Odoragunsen, Ilara and Okela.
					</p>
					<p>The Board registered the Scheme as a Foundation in 2014. With this, the name changed to <strong>Christ the King Catholic Odolewu Humanitarian Foundation.</strong></p>
					<p>The scope of the scheme has kept on expanding till date with more clients and branches. We now have branches in Ago-Iwoye, Sagamu, Ijebu-Ode, Abeokuta, Epe, Idowa, Mowe, Epe II - Lakowe, Ilaro and Ayetoro. The Head office is located in Ijebu-Ode.</p>
					<p>Ck-COHF inaugurated the community primary health care scheme located in Odolewu.  This scheme allows residents of the immediate community access medical care  (consultation and medications) for free.</p>

						<h3>Philosophy:</h3>
						<p>We believe that every human being is created in the image and likeness of God.  Every human being deserves a decent means of livelihood.  They deserve basic healthcare. And so, our services are extended to all human beings irrespective of age, gender, race or creed.  Liberation of every human being from any and all forms of economic, financial  and medical oppression is our goal.  We do not work to just “give fish” to our clients and thus turn them into perpetual dependants.  Rather, we try to help and teach people “how to fish” themselves.  Our operations are motivated and guided by the Catholic Christian value system.</p>
